# Mackintosh_et_al_2023_rearrangement_fixation
Mathematica notebooks and python scripts associated with Mackintosh et al. 2023

## Mathematica notebooks
The notebook brenthis_sweeps_chromosome_scan.nb was used for fitting sweep models to blockwise data. This requires functions from two other notebooks (sit.likelihood_inference_code.nb and sweepsInTime_S1.nb) which are also available here but were written by Bisschop et al. (2021). The notebook finite_island_model.nb was used for fitting models of intraspecific population structure.
